On the landing page:
When reduced to small size, four snippets showing in a 2x2 array is done on purpose.
Personally, I think it looks better than the 1x4 horizontal array.

On the Data Page:
I chose to blend the background and navbar colors in the small media query to make it
one flush design. It expands similary to the homework example at full size.

On the Comparison Page:
<hr> tags and plot titles appear ONLY in the small query. This is because my plots already
have large sized plot titles and it clashes aestheticaly in the full size version. To keep it
professional I chose to use a {display: none;} CSS tag in the large media query.
